This repository contains the answers for the Conceptual &amp; Applied Questions listed in Exercises of every chapter. Also the Lab code has been presented in Python.


The code, or the answers have been taken directly from the below mentioned repositories (None of the content belongs to me). Although the we can find many repos or blogs over internet but none of them I could find at a single repo. Therefor I have collated all the codes or materials under one so that it will help anyone who are interested in the answers or the code to be in Python instead of R.
